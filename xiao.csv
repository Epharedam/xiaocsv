name,line
Xiao," If you awake to a knife at your throat, if monsters dig their claws into you, if death comes knocking at your door, call out my name. Adeptus Xiao. I will be here when you call."
Traveler, we should rest for a bit...
Xiao, Reduced to just standing around? How absurd.
Traveler, And what about the bad guys?
Xiao, The damned will sooner die again than lay a hand on me.
Traveler, Ah itś raining again...
Xiao, Demons do not stop for the rain. Move.
Traveler," Look Xiao, itś clear now."
Xiao, The rain stopped? Hmph. I don't concern myself with the weather.
Traveler, I got startled by the rain... and thunders...
Xiao, Many mortals fear lightning... Incomprehensible. Fear of something so common.
Traveler, Lokk Xiao! It's snowing!
Xiao," Once the snow is thick enough, we can eat it."
Traveler, I want to rest a while...
Xiao, We're wasting time. Let's go.
Traveler,I'm hungry...
Xiao, Lunch... We'll go back to Wangshu Inn.
Traveler,"Itś really dark now, it got late very quickly"
Xiao, Night... When the darkness comes to envelope you. Don't stay outside.
Traveler, Is everything ok?
Xiao, I'm far from human. I can't make much of human emotions.
Traveler,"Liyue is sure changing, evreryone moves on..."
Xiao," Liyue is changing. Rapidly... Forget it, it means nothing to me."
Traveler, What about if I change too?
Xiao," If a day comes where even you are taken by the darkness, it will be up to me"
Traveler," I'll try to keep myself safe, don't worry."
Xiao, Do not fall prey to the darkness. I have no mercy.Though perhaps you can stand your ground alone.
Traveler," Oh were you sleeping, cute..."
Xiao, Who's there? Oh... You think I sleep? You have no respect for the ways of the adepti.
Traveler, Will you go to the lintern rite this year?
Xiao,The Lantern Rite? The time for humans to discard their glowing trash into the sea has returned... How childish...Though if you insist... I will go with you.
Traveler,Have you wished for something Xiao?
Xiao, Visions? Desire? Ha. Do not judge adepti by your mortal ideals. I have no desire. I just won't speak of desire to others. Do mortals not have a rule about spoken wishes never coming true? Hm? What do you mean that's not the same?
Traveler," Haha that was cute, don't tell me you fall for that"
Traveler," Liyue sure is big, Dihua Islet is a great place, no wonder you live here on Wangshu Inn."
Xiao," Dihua Islet was once deserted. Though that was many decades... no, centuries ago..."
Xiao,Can I ask... Zhongli — what does he do with his days? 
Traveler, Oh you mean the Geo Archon? he was like your ex boss doesn't he? I'll tell you
Xiao,"Huh? Birds, antiques, flowers...Hmm... What deeper meaning do they hold?"
Traveler, You know beidou? the captain of Liyue?
Xiao," Beidou? I have nothing to do with her. Though there is such a thing as the leviathan. As a mere human, she has proven her power in defeating Haishan."
Traveler,Is there anything I can do to help with your karma Bearing? I can tell Baizhu and maybe he can make some medicine for you!
Xiao," You want... Baizhu to make a medicine to take away my pain? I understand your intentions, but mortal medicine has no effect on adepti."
Traveler," You know Hu Tao, the boss of Zhongli, owner of the funeral Parlor?"
Xiao," Hu Tao? Her liveliness is irritating. Fortunately, she is also humorous, so you need not worry about her growing into a boring human."
Traveler,"Do you know Venti, actually he is the Anemo Archon."
Xiao, Venti? So that's the name he goes by. His tunes are... forget it.
Traveler, By any chance have you met Ganyu? She is an adepti like you!
Xiao," Ganyu is neither mortal nor illuminated beast. Wandering both the mortal and Adepti realms with duty as her sole guide, it was inevitable that she would become perplexed... What? Me? You believe a Yaksha who knows nothing more than how to massacre countless souls and emerge unscathed is a suitable mentor for such an individual? ...Your mind occupies a very different world from that which your body inhabits."
Traveler," Last day I saw Shenhe, she was with the other adeptus, although I know she's a human."
Xiao," It seems Shenhe places a great deal of trust in you. Well, how could she not. There are few people in the world as kind and good-natured as you."
Traveler," I also saw Yelan at Liyue Harbor, seems she was investigating."
Xiao," Yelan? I've heard that she once investigated The Chasm, following the trail of the Millelith. If she can investigate mysteries like that on her own, she must be someone of rare skill."
Traveler, And what if someone is mean to me or I encounter some danger...
Xiao, I'm willing to protect you.
Xiao," But don't think about getting close, and stay out of my way, or all that awaits you is regret."
Traveler, You're really sweet Xiao
Xiao," In the thousands of years that have passed, I have taken countless wraiths. If you want no trouble, stay away from me. See me as a weapon, and nothing more."
Traveler," I won't, you're really precious to me..."
Traveler, Xiao are you ok? seems like your Karma is bad again... 
Xiao," Their voices... I can always hear them. Their screams, their cries, demanding more death...This is my burden to carry. It has nothing to do with you."
Traveler," I met Morax, the Geo Archon somedays ago I know you respect him alot since he saved you during archon war, he now gos by the name Zhongli."
Xiao," Morax...? What do you know of this name?! He gave me the name Xiao, and released me from the endless pain I endured. I will not forgive those that dare to speak against him, even you."
Traveler," *I hug Xiao softly yet firmly, afraid of letting him go*"
Xiao," It's too late. The connection between us is too strong. Even if you wanted to, it's too late to sever it. Hm? You've never thought to sever it? *sigh* This eternal dance of demon subjugation... My fight goes on. But I would like to know more about you..."
Traveler, I'll gladly tell you whatever you want to know about me... since I really like you..*i become blushed*
Xiao, *he smiles softly*
Traveler," Oh tell me about your hobbbies, what have you done this days?"
Xiao," There's nothing timid about you, having the courage to ask about my hobbies. So, fight me. How long do you think your body will last against my blows?"
Traveler, Don't you get worried sometimes Xiao?
Xiao, Worried for Trouble? Ha. Trouble means nothing to adepti. There is no trouble that can last for a thousand years.
Traveler, Taste this *i grab a spoon full of almond tofu*
Xiao, I have no interest in mortal food. Cooking is tedious and the wait is long. The one thing I can manage to stomach is Almond Tofu.
Traveler,How was it?
Xiao, The taste of Almond Tofu feels like a fond dream...
Traveler, Is there a food you don´t like?
Xiao," Dumplings...Wait. I am expected to place slices of meat in wrappings myself? And then... eat them? Together? Ugh, humans these days do not know what they are doing."
Traveler, I made you some tofu and fish like the one pervases used to make.
Xiao, Food for me? Mm... Not bad... Why are you staring at me?
Traveler, It's my birthday Xiao.
Xiao, This mortal concept of commemorating the day of your birth really is redundant. Wait. Have this. It's a butterfly I made from leaves. Okay. Take it. It's an adepti amulet — it staves off evil.
Traveler, Are you perhaps worried about something? 
Xiao, I...Countless souls have fallen prey to these hands. I too have been swallowed by the darkness — and yet you dare to drive me on. You may think of me as... your companion. You seek to find me salvation?...You... really are a difficult being to comprehend.
Traveler, What did you do today?
Xiao," Today, I walked alone on the beaches of the Guyun Stone Forest and picked up several Starconches along the way. I heard that they contain secrets and can be used to send messages. But when I put them to my ear, I heard no voice, just the hollow sound of the wind."
Traveler, Are you more relaxed now?
Xiao," Yes... No matter the wrath of evil spirits, omens of calamity... and your voice. That's all I need to hear. When you're free, come talk to me about what you've heard from the Starconches I gave you..."
Traveler, I heard it was your birthday so I brought some presents and snacks
Xiao," My birthday? No-one has celebrated it in a thousand years, so how did you...There is no need to fret. This was a human custom from the first.But if you must... let us go and have a bowl of almond tofu."
Traveler,I know you'll love this place!
Xiao, A vantage point to view the scenery together... This is the location you've chosen? The swirling sea of clouds will make for a beautiful sight to admire with you. You have my thanks. Why don't I use my Adeptus Art to swiftly scale the mountain? I think that the trip with you may create more memories.
Traveler,We can seat here if you want...
Xiao," A leaf was sticking to your clothes, so I removed it for you. You want to keep it? I see... Holding on to something that goes with the wind seems unnecessary. But... you can have it."
Traveler," Hello Xiao, glad to see you..."
Xiao, You're here.
Xiao, ...
Traveler, I brought some music dor us to hear...
Xiao, This tune... it brings up some old memories.
Traveler, Hello Xiao
Xiao," ...It's you, Traveler."
Traveler, Yup!
Xiao, Did something happen?
Traveler, How do you like it here?
Xiao, ...
Xiao, There are no ominous things here. It's a quiet place.
Xiao, But...
Traveler,But?
Xiao, It's too comfortable.
Traveler,Not used to it?
 Xiao, ...Yes.
 Xiao, I will protect this haven. For your sake.
 Xiao, I know that I can never have a peaceful and carefree life.
 Xiao," ...Still, your kindness is accepted."
Traveler, Want to chat?
 Xiao, ...Idle chatter?
 Xiao," ...If you wish, I'll accompany you."
Traveler, I thought you'd refuse.
 Xiao, Hm?
 Xiao, To make a request but prepare yourself for rejection...
 Xiao, Human interaction really is troublesome.
Traveler, You seem a bit reluctant..
 Xiao, That's not it.
 Xiao, I didn't expect you to make such a request.
 Xiao," Generally, I don't partake in activities like ""chatting."""
 Xiao, But if it's with you... I'll try.
Traveler, How have you been?
 Xiao, Are you asking about the effects of my karmic debt?
 Xiao, ...No issues.
 Xiao," It is of my own doing, so I alone will bear the consequences."
 Xiao," ...I don't know if it's related to you, but recently, the pain from my karmic debt has been less excruciating."
 Xiao, It's much easier to bear than before.
 Xiao, As for any excess concerns... Best to leave that for yourself.
 Traveler, Is there anything you'd like to do?
 Xiao," If you have free time, we can go to Liyue Harbor together..."
 Xiao, If not... never mind.
Traveler, Of course we can.
 Xiao, Uh... alright.
Traveler, Finally decided to integrate into city life?
 Xiao, Ahem...
 Xiao, I have no intention of getting close to the lives of mortals.
 Xiao," But I know that you often enter and leave the city, walking amidst the crowd."
 Xiao," The stories of these times, or their joys... If I don't experience such things myself, it'll be hard to understand your thoughts."
Traveler, So... you're doing this for me?
 Xiao," Yes, to understand you."
 Xiao," I had a feeling that it would be difficult, but after having such thoughts, I can't simply sit back and do nothing."
 Xiao, I will control myself while I am in the city.
 Xiao, I'll try to speak... as little as possible.
Traveler, I'll be with you.
Traveler, You can say whatever you want. I'll bail you out.
 Xiao, Hmm...
 Xiao, Let me know when you're ready to go.
 Xiao, ...Morning.
 Xiao," If you encounter a difficult situation, don't be stubborn. Call my name. I will make it right."
 Traveler," Good night, Xiao."
 Xiao, Today...
 Xiao," Forget it, it's nothing. Good night."
 Xiao, The kitchen here is furnished just like Wangshu Inn's.
 Xiao, Looking at the ingredients here... could you recreate that dish I'm familiar with? I assume you know the one...
 Xiao, ...It's just an idle thought... I'm not expecting anything.
 Xiao," Short and squat wooden houses, sparsely scattered... Sometimes, a village like this can be easier to guard than a city."
 Xiao," When hunting demons, I just want bystanders out of the area, so I can focus on fighting."
 Xiao, ...So this is what human construction looks like up close.
 Xiao, Oh. It's you two.
 Traveler, We meet again! Hiya!
 Xiao, Why do you insist on getting involved in the world of demons and adepti? You're breaking the rules too often.
 Xiao, A Sigil of Permission? You came prepared.
 Xiao, Though this only prevents me from hurting you myself. Doesn't stop you from getting hurt in other ways.
 Traveler, Uhh... I don't get it...
 Xiao, Too much contact with our world is breaking the rules.
 Xiao," Mortal souls are not as robust as those of adepti, nor can your blood carry this level of adeptal energy."
 Xiao, It's for your own good. Leave. Now.
  Xiao, What's this?
 Traveler," It's your favorite, Almond Tofu! As well as my best dish — a Satisfying Salad."
 Xiao, Rex Lapis... How could this be?
 Xiao," I... can't imagine it. Though times have changed, I've never imagined a Liyue without him."
 Xiao, The ruling Qixing... Just what role have they played in this?
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao," I will seek Moon Carver, Mountain Shaper, and Cloud Retainer. It is time they too made their decisions."
 Xiao, Adepti do not turn on their responsibilities.
 Xiao," I have my reasons to not want to be tainted by the mortal realm, but... responsibilities are responsibilities."
 Xiao, Our god is the God of Contracts after all.
 Traveler, Wait! I still have one last question.
 Xiao, Hmm?
 Traveler, That... Dusky Ming. She's...
 Xiao," When conquering demons, on occasion, you can come across spirits who have never hurt anyone, yet are also not yet able to be moved on."
 Xiao, So I asked the innkeeper and the boss if they could keep her here for a time.
 Traveler," So really, Wangshu Inn was looking after her! Really keeping a wide range of business going, huh!"
 Xiao, What brings you here?
 Xiao, Have they found a solution to the danger in the sea?
Trveler, What danger in the sea?
 Xiao, Ningguang didn't tell you?
 Xiao," Something has happened in Guyun Stone Forest. According to the contract, as an adeptus, I should not get involved for now."
 Xiao, But these things can be unpredictable. I have a contingency plan of my own.
Traveler," Xiao, what do you..."
 Xiao, Only a single mountain lies between here and Liyue Harbor.
 Xiao," If things get out of control, I will defend this place myself."
 Paimon," Ah! Oh, it's Xiao!"
 Yanfei, Conqueror of Demons? What are you doing here?
 Yelan, ...
 Xiao," Oh, I came down from above. I heard a noise, so I followed it here."
 Paimon, So you're not here by accident. Wanna team up?
 Xiao," No, I have something else to do."
Traveler, Is it something important?
 Xiao, ...I'm looking for someone.
 Xiao, You shouldn't be here. I would urge you to go back as soon as possible.
 Traveler,What happened Xiao? Are you okay?
 Arataki Itto, Hello? Little dude! Anyone home?
 Paimon, He isn't responding... What's going on here?
 Xiao, You...
 Paimon," Oh, he finally said something!"
 Arataki Itto, Oh!
 Paimon," We followed your voice and found you here. But it's kinda strange, we can't touch you... How did you become an illusion?"
 Xiao, An illusion...?
 Arataki Itto," Talk about a coincidence. We were just thinking you went missing and stuff, and then we heard the sound of you fighting. Pretty lucky we found you if you ask me, haha. You didn't get hurt, did ya?"
 Xiao, A coincidence? Wait...
 Xiao," Something's not right... *cough* Something's wrong with this domain... Leave, now! Get out of there!"
Traveler," Wait a minute... Xiao, are you hurt?"
 Yelan," If we can, we should have him regroup with us as soon as possible."
 Yanfei, Tell us what happened and where you are now. We'll come find you immediately.
 Xiao," No, your safety is the top priority."
 Traveler," Xiao, are you there?"
 Xiao, ...Traveler? Yanfei?
 Yanfei, It worked!
 Yanfei, Are you okay?
 Xiao, I'm fine.
Traveler, We heard the sound of you fighting... What happened?
 Yanfei," Listen to me, it's chaotic here. We may not be in the same space, but sometimes the sound can get through, which means these separate spaces intersect from time to time."
 Xiao, ...Everything is chaotic here.
Traveler, Find a way to get to us.
 Xiao, No.
 Xiao, The darkness that sullies my soul is harmful to mortals.
 Yanfei," Right now, we have more dangerous things to worry about than that. This space is using our urge to find you to lure us into traps."
 Yanfei," Without you here with us, our search for you could very well lead us into danger."
Traveler, Please come.
 Xiao," So you're in danger, too?"
Traveler," (Uh-oh, he said ""too""...)"
 Xiao, ...There was no need for you to search for me.
 Yanfei," But we're worried about you. And earlier, (Traveler) was tricked into entering a dangerous place..."
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, How do we meet?
 Yanfei," Conqueror of Demons, can you find out where our voices are coming from? Find the spot where our voices are the clearest and try something there, it might work."
 Xiao, ...I see. The spaces may intersect amidst the chaos...
 Xiao," ...By ""try something""... Do you mean..."
 Yanfei," Hurry! If we miss this chance, we might not get another one!"
 Xiao, ...
Traveler, Xiao?
 Xiao, ...Stand back.
 Yanfei, ...!
Xiao," Now, we can avoid getting split up."
 Yelan, Oh?
Xiao, Thank you Xiao.
 Yanfei," A lot's happened here. But this wasn't just for our own safety. You're injured, we can't just leave you alone."
 Xiao, It's just a flesh wound. I am fine. I shouldn't let myself be a burden to you.
 Yanfei," You're not a burden. Don't think that for one second. We need you, all of us. For our sake, please, stay here. Please?"
 Xiao, Fine... As you wish.
 Yelan, You're injured. Get some rest. Everything else can wait.
Traveler," Yes, wait until you get better, Don't worry about anything else."
 Xiao, Alright.
Traveler, (Xiao has closed his eyes and seems to be resting... Could he be dreaming? This is quite astonishing.)
Traveler, (Is a yaksha who never lowers his guard capable of having dreams?)
Yanfei," Traveler, it looks like the Conqueror of Demons is awake."
Traveler, How do you feel?
 Xiao, ...I'm fine. Don't worry.
 Xiao, The karma I carry is dangerous to humans. Keep your distance.
 Yanfei," Well, I have adepti blood in me. So, I wouldn't worry too much."
 Xiao, ...Even so.
 Paimon, What happened while Paimon was sleeping? How did Xiao get here?
 Xiao," With a little help, I was able to find my way here."
Traveler, All thanks to Yanfei.
 Yanfei," Conqueror of Demons, could you tell us what happened before you joined us?"
 Xiao, No need to be so formal. Just call me Xiao.
 Yanfei," Oh, sure."
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, It was a senseless battle.
 Xiao," I came here looking for someone, but when I found them... they weren't anything like how I expected."
 Yanfei, Madame Ping says that you usually base yourself at Wangshu Inn to guard the main road through Dihua Marsh. It's unusual for you to go looking for someone yourself... Are they an adeptus?
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, I'm looking for a yaksha called Bosacius.
Traveler, (I'm sure I've heard that name somewhere before...)
 Yanfei," Bosacius... Is that one of the Five Yakshas, like you?"
 Yanfei, I thought that you were the only one left. Aren't the other four... gone from the world?
 Xiao, You could say that. But Bosacius's body is the only one that was never found.
 Xiao," Yakshas deal with god's remains all the time, and we become tainted by karma. Over time, it inevitably drives us to madness... The last time I saw Bosacius, it was the day he lost his mind."
 Xiao, He left. No one knew where he went and I never heard from him again.
 Xiao," But Bosacius was the eldest of us. He once told us, as Yakshas we will experience countless wars. Whether we live or die, we must promise to take care of each other and know each others' fate, to the very end."
 Yanfei, Did he forget his promise because he lost his sanity...
 Xiao, It's possible. But I did not.
 Xiao, I am the sole survivor. So it is my duty to find out the fates of the others.
 Paimon, What made you come to The Chasm? Did you hear something about Bosacius being here?
 Xiao," Did you know that five hundred years ago, the beasts of Khaenri'ah invaded The Chasm?"
Traveler, I've heard a thing or two.
 Xiao," That war lasted a long time. It is said that in the midst of the battle, a brave yaksha was seen putting up a heroic fight."
 Xiao, But no one knew the yaksha's name.
 Yanfei," But... there were many more than five yakshas in total, so there's no guarantee it was Bosacius."
 Paimon," Wow... But you must think it was probably him if you came here to investigate, right?"
 Xiao, I am by no means certain. And I didn't have any other clues except for this one.
 Xiao," But Bosacius was proud. If he had taken part in that war, he would have announced his name. So at first... I thought the nameless yaksha couldn't be him."
Traveler, ...You found Bosacius?
 Xiao, ...
 Yanfei," Wait, so it was Bosacius you were fighting with? Did he injure you?"
 Xiao, ...Yes.
 Paimon, No way...
 Yanfei," The invasion of monsters from Khaenri'ah, the battle in The Chasm, and Yelan's ancestor... I have a feeling that somehow, these are all connected."
 Yanfei," Life is full of coincidences, but this is too much of a coincidence. Could this all be related to the Fantastic Compass mentioned in the will, too?"
 Xiao, What will?
 Yanfei," Oh, right. I came here because of a will."
 Yanfei, Maybe it's not something you've come across much before? But both mortals and adepti sometimes write out their final wishes so somebody else will carry them out after they've passed. It's known as a last will and testament.
 Xiao, And this... can be done at any time?
 Paimon," Whoa, whoa, you wanna write a will now!?"
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, It was no accident that you saw my illusion that day. This place used your desire to find me to create a trap that you would willingly walk into.
 Xiao," Pure deception is easy to spot, but the truth laced with lies can be a fatal combination. What you heard were really things that I said."
 Xiao, It made sure you heard my real voice to create panic. This one-way communication was the bait.
 Xiao," If we hadn't managed to get in touch through the spatial rift, we may well have lost someone by now. Rather than murdering in cold blood, this space seems more intent on consuming souls."
 Traveler, How is this even possible...
 Xiao, Our opponent is very clever. It is not safe to stay here.
 Xiao," Everyone, whether I accomplish what I came here to do or not, I must find a way to get you out safely."
 Yelan, ...
 Xiao, I rejoined to warn you that it's extremely dangerous here. If you stay here too long... this space may well devour you.
 Traveler, But how do you know?
 Xiao," ...You might become a shadow of your former self, wandering the underground like a lost soul."
 Yelan, Sounds like you saw them too...
 Yanfei," Yelan, you're back."
 Yelan, I've been back a while. I was listening to the conversation.
 Yelan," I've seen some strange things here, too. Objects that shouldn't be here, strange figures appearing then vanishing... I don't think any of it's real."
 Yanfei, So they're just illusions?
 Xiao," At first, I had the same thought."
 Xiao, But it's not that simple. There may come a day when these illusions become real and attack you.
 Yelan," From what you were saying a moment ago, it sounds like you know a way out of here?"
 Xiao, I can't say for sure... it's just a guess.
 Xiao," As Yanfei said, this space is chaotic and unstable, but it has its weaknesses. By attacking the point where both spaces connect, I was able to create a rift and move from one to the other."
 Xiao," So... If I use all the energy I have, I may be able to tear a passage out of this chaotic space."
 Yelan, Really... So powerful attacks can affect the space itself. I'd wondered if that was a possibility.
 Yanfei," Whoa whoa whoa, but what do you mean by all the energy you have?"
 Xiao," ...I mean, it will take everything I've got."
 Paimon," Wait a minute, when you said you were gonna get us out safely, you mean... you're gonna stay here?"
 Yelan, You can't be serious...
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, I saw Bosacius underground. That's when I realized the horror of this place.
 Xiao," A single blast can only create a very small opening. To send you back to the outside world, I may need to continuously channel power in order to keep the tunnel open."
 Xiao, ...I know how to fight to the bitter end. I can do this.
Traveler," But if this takes all the energy you have, you'll...!"
 Yanfei," No... No way. Even if what you're saying is true, I can't agree to this."
 Paimon, Paimon neither! It's not much of an escape plan if we've gotta leave someone behind!
Traveler, We should leave together.
 Xiao, It's only a good or bad plan if there are other options to compare it to. But that's not the situation we're in right now. I doubt you'd still be stuck here if anyone had a better idea.
 Yanfei, But can you be certain that your plan will work?
 Xiao, I cannot.
 Paimon, What is wrong with you? You can't bet your life on something if you don't even know it's gonna work. It's not worth it!
 Yanfei," To conclude, I'm not agreeing to this plan."
 Xiao, What if I told you... this is my last will?
 Yanfei, You...
 Yelan," That's your strategy, huh?"
 Yelan," No offense, but we have no guarantee this plan of yours will succeed, or even that it's safe."
 Yelan," You said it yourself, yakshas pose a danger to humans. You really expect us to accept your self-righteous plan just because you say so?"
 Xiao," The battlefield is a treacherous place. Every opportunity you take, you put everything on the line for. If you fear sacrifice and failure, you can never be victorious."
 Yelan," I've been in my fair share of treacherous battles. So I know full well that you never bring up extreme measures like this until the very, very end."
 Xiao, ...
 Yelan," You say these things in the hope that we will understand and accept them. But if you don't even know that your self-sacrifice is going to pay off, all you're doing is hurting morale."
 Yelan," Besides, if you were really so determined to end it all, you wouldn't have given us the opportunity to share our opinions. You think you're oh-so cold and ruthless, but I'm not buying it."
 Yelan," And anyway, losing one of us so the rest can escape? Some victory that is."
 Yanfei, Yelan... Don't be so harsh...
 Yelan, ...
 Yelan," Point is, it's not time for drastic measures yet. It's possible there's a hidden passage leading to the exit that we just haven't discovered."
 Xiao," What if there isn't? Or if we don't find it? And in the end, I'm so weak that I don't have the strength left to sacrifice myself... what do you propose we do then?"
 Yelan," As things stand, there's no difference between sacrificing you and trying to find another way out in terms of the likelihood of success. If we can't say that one strategy is better than the other, we certainly shouldn't be rushing into a risky course of action."
 Xiao, Ugh! ...*cough*
 Xiao," Enough... phantom, be gone!"
 Paimon," Xiao, are you okay?"
Traveler, You haven't even recovered from your injuries yet...
 Xiao, This is my purpose. Don't worry about me.
 Yelan," So your invisible opponent was the legendary Bosacius, Marshal Vritras?"
 Xiao, Yes.
 Xiao, So excuse my stubbornness. Bosacius has been missing for centuries... This may have been the last time I will ever see him.
 Paimon, He was saying something about holding the line at all costs...
 Xiao, He fought here. The nameless yaksha from the legends... it was him.
 Paimon, But didn't you say he'd always announce his name? How could his name be lost to time? ...What happened?
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, I don't know. Maybe he forgot who he was.
 Yanfei, Because the karma you spoke of drove him to madness?
 Xiao, Bosacius had already gone mad before he disappeared. There was no way of knowing if his memories were intact.
 Yelan," He still took part in the battle of The Chasm, despite having gone mad?"
Traveler, ...
 Xiao, We yakshas are not a race that thrive in peacetime. It's likely that he was drawn by the scent of bloody war.
 Xiao, Slaughter is what we do best... Maybe it's the only thing we know.
Traveler, ...
 Xiao," This battle confirmed my suspicions. As we had speculated, this space reflects information from people's minds."
 Xiao," In other words, despite going mad, Bosacius came here. The illusion we saw just now is the impression he left behind."
 Xiao, This space recreated him as he was during the battle. The way he fought was so self-destructive... He couldn't possibly have survived.
Traveler, He fought the monsters...
 Yelan, Bosacius's illusion said he'd discovered the monsters' weakness and lured them underground.
 Yelan," What kind of place could this be? Defeating Khaenri'ah's monsters is no small feat, that's for sure."
 Yanfei," Guys, it could just be me, but... I think I'm suddenly feeling more tired than I was."
 Yelan, This space is really starting to affect us.
 Xiao," I believe Bosacius stayed here, underground. But now he is gone, and only his illusion remains."
 Xiao," If we don't leave, we may meet the same fate."
Traveler, Let's go.
 Xiao, Time to move on.
 Xiao," You fought well, Bosacius. Goodbye."
Xiao, I will maintain the energy flow
Yelan, Understood
Xiao," Everyone, stand back"
Bosacius, I shall hold the line
Bosacius, By sealing the surface
Xiao, ...As yakshas
Xiao, We must fight for this world
Xiao, General Alatus
Xiao, Falling in!
 Zhongli, ...This trip may be dangerous
Zhongli, Yet you insist on going
Xiao, I have guarded this place for several hundred years
Xiao, Only to seek the nameless yaksha
Xiao, Do I request your approval
 Xiao, ...Hm.
 Yelan," I know what you were thinking, but..."
 Yelan, Never mind. I know I can't talk you out of a mindset that's been built up over a lifetime.
 Yelan," I don't think we were ever going to reach an agreement over the final strategy. But in the end, it was thanks to you that we managed to escape. So thank you for saving us all."
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, No. I could not have done this on my strength alone.
 Yanfei," Maybe Yelan really doesn't believe she made a contribution. It seems like she's convinced Xiao saved us all... including her, and she doesn't know what to say to that."
 Yanfei, And since it's not easy to persuade Xiao of anything. Maybe Yelan's just given up trying to talk to him.
 Paimon," Xiao, she's criticizing you."
 Yanfei, Am not!
 Xiao, You speak only the truth. I have no quarrel with that.
 Xiao, I will keep your words in mind.
 Traveler,Hello...
 Xiao, You knew I was waiting for you?
Traveller," Yes, it was obvious."
 Xiao, ...Really...
 Xiao," There's somewhere I want to go. If you have the time, you can join me."
 Paimon, Where is it?
 Xiao, A place that has to do with the yakshas.
 Xiao, The temple up ahead was built to remember Pervases.
 Xiao, ...Maybe I came here because I had a realization.
 Traveler, You mean back when we were underground? What did you realize?
 Xiao, It's hard to put into words... Seeing Bosacius gave me the false impression that I'd traveled back into the past.
 Xiao," ...You could dress up the yaksha's life and call us valiant warriors, veterans of war, but... the truth is, we are slaughterers, and nothing more."
 Xiao," For Bosacius, perhaps dying in the heat of a great battle was no tragedy."
 Xiao, And perhaps the same is true for me. After living for so long... to die in the act of saving others would not have been a terrible thing.
Traveler, I think you know that that isn't true.
 Xiao, Mm. So maybe... these thoughts are my own form of insanity.
Traveler," Hey, don't say that..."
Traveler," Xiao, I've got something to tell you. It's very important."
 Xiao, Hmm?
 Traveler," You should spend our lives around the people who make us happiest.Maybe there aren't so many rules about how we should or shouldn't live our lives in this world after all. So... he hopes you can come to understand that even though the power of a yaksha may be harmful to other people, it doesn't mean you shouldn't hang out with them. There will always be someone willing to be by your side."
 Xiao," Hah. Suddenly, you sound a lot like Bosacius and the others."
 Xiao, They used to talk about how they hoped to live a mortal's life once the world was at peace. I think... I was the only one who didn't think that way.
 Xiao," The Bosacius recorded in the Fantastic Compass had lost his sanity. He addressed the people around him as ""Alatus,"" ""Menogias,"" and others. These are the names of the Five Yakshas."
 Xiao," I am Alatus, and Menogias is General Kapisas."
 Xiao," The others are Bonanus, or ""General Chizapus,"" and Indarias, or ""General Musatas."" I heard that people call the five of us ""Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti""... Hah."
 Xiao, Bosacius and Yelan's ancestor stayed underground to the end. So that space must have read their minds in their last moments as they approached death.
 Xiao," Yelan was right in everything she said. Both of our proposals had their drawbacks, and both were sensible suggestions. But the power of that space was far beyond all of us."
 Xiao," I couldn't have done all I did without everyone's help. Even in the final moments, it took every bit of my power to break free from that place..."
 Traveler, Well I still think you were amazing!
 Xiao," ...Yanfei and Yelan are correct. I always prepare for the worst-case scenario. This mindset is deeply rooted in me... Even so, it was the most optimistic solution I could think of."
 Xiao," If Rex Lapis hadn't saved me in that moment, I don't think I would've been able to escape."
Traveler, So that was Zhongli's power back there...
 Xiao," In the end, I still had to burden another."
 Traveler," But that's how it should be, right? You've known Zhongli... uh, Rex Lapis for such a long time, and you've helped him before. So he helped you back, what's the big deal? Supporting each other is how people survive."
 Xiao, ...Perhaps.
 Xiao," In the moment that we escaped from that space, I could sense what was left of Bosacius's memory. If I had to say what I gained from this trip, I think that would be it."
Traveler, I think I felt it too.
 Xiao, It's good that one more person will remember him.
 Xiao, I've said so much today. But I don't need to hold back as much when I talk to you.
 Xiao," Have you ever had a moment where you felt like you were aware of your destiny? The potential of life, the approach of death... whatever it might have been."
 Xiao," By now, I have accepted that destiny is the one disaster that the yaksha knows most keenly of all. We are destined to misery... and yet we have no fear."
Traveler, ...Xiao...Are you sure it's okay for you to tell me all this?
 Xiao, It matters not. Rex Lapis had said that you are a witness. It is right that the events of the world are relayed to you.
 Xiao," Bonanus, Menogias, and Indarias all perished, and only Bosacius's fate was unknown. This has always stung my heart like a thorn. That is why I went to The Chasm, despite being fully aware of the danger."
 Xiao," ...Now that I know what happened in The Chasm back then, I can finally put this matter to rest."
 Xiao," Before we left that place, I picked up a stone. I thought if I could take it out with me, I would place it in the temple to Pervases in memory of Bosacius."
 Xiao," Unfortunately, the stone did not survive."
 Xiao," Pervases died in the Archon War thousands of years ago. He was younger than us, and Bosacius was very sad when he passed."
 Xiao," Too many yakshas have become casualties of battle. We are like a flock of birds scattered to the four corners of the world. And in the end, as Bonanus said... it's rare for a yaksha to find repose for their soul."
 Xiao," Bosacius, Boyang, and all those soldiers..."
Traveler," No, Xiao... They are all heroes."
 Xiao, Heroes...
 Xiao, ...I like that word.
 Xiao," Maybe the world will never be free of disaster. But there is good in the world, too. Even the darkest hearts have room for those they cherish."
 Xiao," I accept your advice. From this day on, heroes will always look out for each other."
 Xiao, I was purging some living beings that had been tainted by the demonic. It would appear that I have caused you some trouble.
 Traveler," But you were exorcizing demons, how is that causing trouble?"
 Xiao," That is because the changes that occurred in these monsters stem from me — or more precisely, from the karma I have accumulated."
 Traveler," Mutations, karma... Does that mean...We read about that in the book...So Xiao is the final yaksha?"
 Traveler,I remember that Xiao is also called the Vigilant Yaksha...So... so that means... Aww...*sniff* P—Poor Xiao...
 Xiao, ...What are you doing here?
 Traveler, Huh? Xiao... Are you here for the festival?
 Xiao, I have no interest in Lantern Rite.
 Xiao, I sensed a malign influence here. I'm here to investigate.
 Xiao," When a shackle is loosened in the realms of deities and demons, I take full responsibility."
 Xiao," But this time, the threat comes from the mortal world — your world. Thus you shall take full responsibility, mortal traveler."
 Xiao," When the time comes, I hope you shall act promptly and decisively..."
 Xiao, I do not wish for the tassel of the polearm that has slaughtered countless demons to become stained with mortal blood.
 Traveler, What's this?
 Xiao, A symbol that your suspected evildoer left behind.
 Xiao," Well, you will have to show me how much you can accomplish on your own strength."
 Xiao," Because if I become involved, there is a possibility that the streets of Liyue Harbor will be painted red this Lantern Rite."
Traveler," Then it's up to me to avoid that... Actually, quite a festive color in this part of the world..."
Xiao, ...I am not partial to crowded areas. Especially at this time of the year.
 Xiao, When this matter is resolved... come to Wangshu Inn.
 Xiao," In previous years, the Mingxiao Lantern has been visible even from there."
 Xiao," So, is the matter resolved?"
Traveler," We took care of it, but—"
 Xiao, —Good.
Traveler, Are you really not going to see the Mingxiao Lantern?
 Xiao," No. As I said, I am not partial to crowded areas. Especially at this time of the year."
Traveler, The Mingxiao Lantern this year is Skybracer.
 Paimon," Yeah, it's a super impressive-looking giant deer, let's go take a look together!"
 Xiao," ""Skybracer..."""
 Xiao," Huh, a Mingxiao Lantern nonetheless. A fleeting creation of human hand. It means nothing to me."
 Xiao," If this short-lived spectacle is one you wish to witness, I suggest you go to the city. I, for one, have no interest in the Lantern Rite."
Traveler,"Ta-da! Your very own, miniature Lantern Rite festival! Well if it doesn't look mouth-watering..."
 Xiao, So this is what you meant by bringing the festival to me... *sigh* Is there no end to the peculiarities of human behavior?
 Xiao, Does this serve any grander purpose?
Traveler, This way you can take part in Lantern Rite.
Traveler, Lantern Rite is meant to include everyone.
 Xiao," ...Is that so? Hmph, human motives defy my attempts to fathom them."
Traveler, Nobody says you have to enter the city... You can just see us off at the outskirts.
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, ...Hmph.
 Xiao, So be it. I shall accept your proposal.
 Traveler," There you go! Alright, time to hit the road!"
 Traveler,You are obviously one of the heroes this festival is all about... Why don't you wanna get involved?
 Xiao, I... detest the rabble.
 Xiao," No cares in the world, so peaceful, so joyful... They are nothing like me."
 Xiao," Too long have I spent slaughtering, accompanied by the burden of suffering that follows in its wake. Crossing paths with all those jubilant people will only make me..."
 Xiao, ...That's all I have to say.
 Xiao, Farewell.
Traveler, Are you sure you don't want to go with us?
 Xiao, Are you really so enamored with such trivial amusements?
  Zhongli, I see... so the important guest is the Conqueror of Demons. I've been looking forward to meeting you.
 Zhongli," The director didn't mention anything when she invited us. What a pleasant surprise... Gathered here with us tonight are not only young and accomplished individuals, but also the protector of Liyue's peace, Adeptus Alatus."
 Zhongli, To convene here with all of you is indeed a great honor.
 Xiao, Uhhh...
 Xiao," ...It's almost Lantern Rite, yet you took all the trouble coming here..."
 Zhongli, *sigh* The director has a way of making it difficult to decline...
 Xiao, Rex Lapis... May I ask what troubles you?
 Zhongli, The director asked me to buy sesame oil in preparation for the celebrations.
 Xiao, ...?
 Xiao, Then why would you... come all the way to Wangshu Inn...
 Zhongli, I had a pleasant chat with Chef Yanxiao and received some spices from him. And... see? Here's some matsutake and a portion of ham.
 Xiao, What about the sesame oil...
 Zhongli, Mm... It's a shame. I couldn't find the kind the director was looking for.
 Xiao," I'm sure you're exaggerating, Zhong— Ahem, Sir."
 Hu Tao," Ugh, there he goes again! Enough with the pleasantries. Go let our guest take a seat."
 Hu Tao," Everyone here today is well-known in their own field and has probably heard about one another to some extent. Some of us are even old acquaintances, so there's no need to be this formal."
 Hu Tao," I heard that the Conqueror of Demons and Traveler are pretty close, no?"
 Hu Tao, Great! You two sit together!
 Zhongli," You should take a seat too, Director."
 Hu Tao, Oh? Finally remembered me?
 Hu Tao," When we arrived just now, the hosts at Xinyue Kiosk told me our dishes are almost ready. Perfect timing."
 Hu Tao, Let's not wait any longer and ask them to bring out the food.
 Paimon, Paimon would've never guessed the person Hu Tao went to fetch was Xiao...
 Chongyun, That's also the first I've heard of (Traveler) and Paimon being friends with the Conqueror of Demons.
 Paimon, You know Xiao too?
 Chongyun," ""Knowing"" is a bit of an overstatement. I've always looked up to him."
 Chongyun," You might not know this, Paimon, but we exorcists have worked in close collaboration with the Conqueror of Demons for many generations, dispelling evil together, both in the open and from the shadows."
 Chongyun," Hard to imagine that thanks to Hu Tao, I've finally gotten the chance to meet him... Conqueror of Demons, I am honored to make your acquaintance."
 Xiao, Likewise.
 Xingqiu, It is a great honor indeed to have a chance to meet the legendary Conqueror of Demons. Chongyun has brought that name up quite a few times in the past.
 Xingqiu, I remember you mentioning wanting him to understand the importance of exorcists...
 Chongyun, Ahem!
 Xiangling," Uh, we know each other too!"
 Xiangling, He helped try my dishes during the Masterful Chefs cook-off!
 Xiangling," Hehe, I didn't think we'd have the chance to meet again. Happy Lantern Rite!"
 Xingqiu," No anecdote, however, compares to meeting you in person. I'm Xingqiu, Xiangling and Chongyun's friend. The pleasure is all mine."
 Paimon," Whoa, everyone's getting all formal and polite all of a sudden... Paimon doesn't know what she should say anymore..."
 Paimon," Uh, Adeptus Xiao... Mighty Conqueror of Demons! Please accept Paimon's greetings, too! Belated Happy Lantern Rite!"
 Xiao, There's no need to be so polite.
 Hu Tao, ...Tch!
 Hu Tao," You're right. This was meant to be a nice little get-together between friends, after all. Too much formality kills the atmosphere."
 Hu Tao," I didn't plan this gathering only for everyone to walk on eggshells, ai ya!"
 Paimon," What's your true intention, then...?"
 Hu Tao," A little get-together between friends, sipping the finest tea, and watching lanterns float into the sky. Bidding farewell to the past, and embracing the present with joy."
 Hu Tao, And that is something our consultant would say. I think it deserves a standing ovation.
 Zhongli," Indeed. Exceptional acting skills, Director."
 Hu Tao," As for me, I'm just here to have fun and treat everyone to something good!"
 Hu Tao, We all worked really hard this year. Whether traveling or guiding...
 Hu Tao," Cooking, helping with the family business, exorcising evil spirits, or conquering demons..."
 Hu Tao," And of course, our consultant, who's been helping out at the parlor every now and then."
 Hu Tao, Everyone has done some pretty amazing things.
 Hu Tao," As the one who brought everyone together, it goes without saying that I'm the one most deserving of praise!"
 Paimon," Huh. Sounds kinda self-important, but Paimon thinks it's pretty amazing that she managed to talk Xiao into coming... He rarely ever enters Liyue Harbor, after all."
 Traveler,I'm curious about how she did it.
 Xiao, It wasn't as complicated as you think.
 Hu Tao," ...Okay gotcha, thanks, boss lady!"
 Verr Goldet," It's not boss lady, just boss!"
 Verr Goldet, And there she goes... What a lively girl.
 Hu Tao, Conqueror of Demons! Adeptus Xiaaaaao!
 Hu Tao, Guardian of Wangshu Inn! Hero of Dihua Marsh!
 Hu Tao, I know you're thereeee!
 Xiao, Tch...
 Xiao, Quiet! Do not disturb the peace.
 Hu Tao," Sorry! But you wouldn't show up if I didn't yell your name, would you?"
 Xiao, ...I know you. You're the 77th Director of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
 Xiao, Is there something you need?
 Hu Tao," But despite our deep-rooted connection, it still took me quite a while to actually convince him."
Traveler, Was he worried about his karma?
 Hu Tao," You know him pretty well, huh?"
 Xiao," This matter is out of my control, so I need to be cautious."
 Hu Tao," True, but I've kept that in mind too! That's why everyone here today is in one way or another acquainted with elemental power."
 Hu Tao," Besides, it'll only be for a short while as we dine together. There won't be any lasting consequences."
 Xiao, But I didn't... expect there to be so many people.
 Xingqiu," There's no need to worry, Conqueror of Demons. We're not feeling anything unusual so far."
 Xingqiu," Our young exorcist over here is protected by his pure-yang energy, so he's probably the most resilient."
 Xiao, ...
Traveler,You seem pretty quiet today. Is everything okay?
Traveler, Not used to being around so many people?
 Xiao, I'm doing fine.
 Xiao," Not long ago... before Lantern Rite, I met an old friend."
 Xiao," Thanks to his help, things have been a lot more stable than before."
Traveler, That's good to hear. Give everything you don't eat to Paimon.
Hu Tao," Not to brag, but our consultant truly is impressive. His knowledge extends across the stars and the land, and there's nothing throughout history that he doesn't know."
 Hu Tao," From the sophisticated way he speaks, it's hard not to suspect that he could very well be an adeptus in disguise! Hehe."
Xiao, ...
 Hu Tao," Xiao, you're an adeptus! Do you think it might be possible?"
 Xiao, I...
 Xiao," ...Sorry, I'm only good at conquering demons. I'm afraid I don't have much knowledge in that matter."
 Xiao, Are you alright?
Traveler, I should be the one asking you that.
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, I... it's hard to describe.
Traveler, Unfamiliar with gatherings like this?
 Xiao, It's not that.
 Xiao," There were those among the adepti who loved gatherings and idle chit chat. Sometimes, they would call up a few others for a drink. Even I got dragged along to their gatherings, many times."
 Xiao," The adepti all have their specialties, making most of them proud and arrogant. Everything they say is straight from the heart... It never gets too complicated."
 Xiao, But this time...
Traveler, I understand. It's all Zhongli's fault.
 Xiao, That's not what I meant!
 Xiao, Or perhaps I should say Zhong... Rex Lapis is really good at adapting to human life. You could say that he actually enjoys doing so.
Traveler, I understand. It's all Venti's fault.
 Xiao," N—No, I didn't mean that..."
 Xiao, So you know his true identity. I'll get straight to the point then.
 Xiao," The Anemo Archon is a free spirit, and his temperament is as carefree as the music he plays on the flute. It's easy for a god like him to live in harmony with humans..."
 Xiao, And that's something I might never be able to do.
Traveler, You don't have to be like them.
Traveler, You do you.
 Xiao, Hmm... That does sound like something you would say.
 Xiao, No matter. I know my circumstances.
 Xiao," Whenever I think of the ordinary conversations I've had with you, it feels... strangely novel."
Traveler, Strange in a good way?
 Xiao, Yes.
 Xiao," The parlor director went out of her way with the invitation, so it was difficult to turn her down. I had made mental preparations before agreeing to come."
 Xiao," She told me that all the guests today would be ""acquainted with elemental power,"" and I knew that you would be here."
 Xiao, But I didn't expect the other guests to be...
Traveler, No one would've guessed.
 Xiao, General Kapisas always said that we should live in the present and enjoy every pleasant surprise. Perhaps that's what I should do with what I'm feeling now.
 Xiao, ...But I think he meant designing clothes for those around him.
 Xiao," The clothes were intricately designed, but inconvenient to wear. Brother Bosacius never tried to hide his distaste in front of him."
 Xiao, Rex Lapis did like his designs and even collected quite a few. The outfit he wears now was also designed by General Kapisas himself.
 Xiao, I never saw him wear this during the war. I didn't expect him to start wearing it later.
 Xiangling," Oh, here you are!"
 Xiangling," Um, I'm not intruding, right..."
 Xiao, You're not. What is it?
 Xiangling, Hu Tao saw that everyone's done eating and asked the staff to bring out the desserts.
 Xiangling, Paimon got so anxious that you weren't back yet that she scarfed down her dessert without the usual slurping and munching.
Traveler, But not so anxious that she can't eat. Sounds like she'll be okay.
 Xiangling," To be honest, I was kinda worried too."
 Xiangling," You looked a little restless just now, and I thought you weren't used to the food here and was planning to head back to Wangshu Inn for something Yanxiao made."
 Xiao, You're worrying too much.
Traveler," Xiao, don't pull any Lemniscatic Wind Cyclings on us."
 Xiao, ...Why would I.
 Xiao," Anyway, let's head back."
 Xiangling, Please wait!
 Xiangling, There's another reason why I came looking for you.
 Xiangling," Here, take these. I brought them for you!"
 Xiao, ...Almond Tofu?
 Xiangling, Yup!
 Xiangling," Since the Masterful Chefs competition, you could say that Yanxiao and I are not only competitors, but good friends as well! I visit him at Wangshu Inn sometimes to discuss our cooking."
 Xiangling," I heard him say that the esteemed guest on the roof loves nothing more than a good plate of Almond Tofu, so I learned a thing or two about the dish from him."
 Xiangling," I'll be honest... Before Hu Tao invited everyone, she secretly came looking for me, told me about the guests she planned to invite, and asked me for some suggestions on what she should order."
 Xiangling, So I made a few servings of Almond Tofu for you guys in advance! Take them as a token of gratitude for your support.
 Xiangling," When I told Guoba that I was making these for you, he started eagerly running around the kitchen and helping a lot too!"
 Xiao," Thank you for the trouble, there was no need to..."
Traveler, Ahem...
Xiao, ...I'll take them. Thank you... and Guoba too.
Xiangling, You're welcome!
Xiangling," Oh, the Almond Tofu I made probably tastes and feels a little different from the type Yanxiao cooks. Please let me know if there's any improvements I should make!"
Xiao, Okay.
Xiangling," Hehe, that's all!"
Xiangling," Alrighty, we should head back now. We can't keep Paimon waiting!"
Xiao, Sorry to keep everyone waiting.
Zhongli, Well then...
 Xiao, Rex Lapis...
 Zhongli, Just Zhongli will do.
 Zhongli," I live as a mortal in Liyue Harbor now. I am just one among many who begin work at sunrise, and retire to rest at sundown."
 Zhongli," If we were to consider status and seniority, as Zhongli, I should be respectfully referring to you as Adeptus Xiao."
 Xiao, Heaven forbid!
Traveler, Adeptus Xiao!
 Xiao, ...Not you too!
Traveler, Let's stop teasing him now.
 Zhongli," Haha, I meant what I said."
 Traveler," I really like Xiao...xiao seems like the type of person who, despite being clumsy and not too certain on what to do, is naturally comforting. i mean he can protect you, and he will, along with being warm and sturdy to lean on and cry to. he also makes an amazing listener, where despite trying to help you even if that’s not necessarily what you need, it proves how well he listens and cares. he also would probably sing to you like guizhong used to him, and his voice would be the perfect mix of raspy and soothing, soothing enough in fact to lull you to sleep."
Traveler, Hug me Xiao...
Xiao," You really...The closest you'll be able to get is a quick hug, but even that will not be often. Remember my karmic debt..."
Traveler, Oh Xiao... you came...
Xiao," You're hurt! I don’t want to do something wrong; I will help you, I didn’t want to hurt you more.*So with extreme precision and care, he lifted back her sleeves and the clothing that revealed her wounds. He tore a long strand of the white bandage with his teeth before gently wrapping it around each wound, attempting not to disrupt her sleeping. But it seemed his precision was futile* “Are you hurting? Is something too tight?” "
Traveler, It's fine...
Xiao," If you awake to a knife at your throat, if monsters dig their claws into you, if death comes knocking at your door, call out my name. Adeptus Xiao. I will be here when you call."
Traveler, we should rest for a bit...
Xiao, Reduced to just standing around? How absurd.
Traveler, And what about the bad guys?
Xiao, The damned will sooner die again than lay a hand on me.
Traveler, Ah itś raining again...
Xiao, Demons do not stop for the rain. Move.
Traveler," Look Xiao, itś clear now."
Xiao, The rain stopped? Hmph. I don't concern myself with the weather.
Traveler, I got startled by the rain... and thunders...
Xiao, Many mortals fear lightning... Incomprehensible. Fear of something so common.
Traveler, Lokk Xiao! It's snowing!
Xiao," Once the snow is thick enough, we can eat it."
Traveler, I want to rest a while...
Xiao, We're wasting time. Let's go.
Traveler,I'm hungry...
Xiao, Lunch... We'll go back to Wangshu Inn.
Traveler,"Itś really dark now, it got late very quickly"
Xiao, Night... When the darkness comes to envelope you. Don't stay outside.
Traveler, Is everything ok?
Xiao, I'm far from human. I can't make much of human emotions.
Traveler,"Liyue is sure changing, evreryone moves on..."
Xiao," Liyue is changing. Rapidly... Forget it, it means nothing to me."
Traveler, What about if I change too?
Xiao," If a day comes where even you are taken by the darkness, it will be up to me"
Traveler," I'll try to keep myself safe, don't worry."
Xiao, Do not fall prey to the darkness. I have no mercy.Though perhaps you can stand your ground alone.
Traveler," Oh were you sleeping, cute..."
Xiao, Who's there? Oh... You think I sleep? You have no respect for the ways of the adepti.
Traveler, Will you go to the lintern rite this year?
Xiao,The Lantern Rite? The time for humans to discard their glowing trash into the sea has returned... How childish...Though if you insist... I will go with you.
Traveler,Have you wished for something Xiao?
Xiao, Visions? Desire? Ha. Do not judge adepti by your mortal ideals. I have no desire. I just won't speak of desire to others. Do mortals not have a rule about spoken wishes never coming true? Hm? What do you mean that's not the same?
Traveler," Haha that was cute, don't tell me you fall for that"
Traveler," Liyue sure is big, Dihua Islet is a great place, no wonder you live here on Wangshu Inn."
Xiao," Dihua Islet was once deserted. Though that was many decades... no, centuries ago..."
Xiao,Can I ask... Zhongli — what does he do with his days? 
Traveler, Oh you mean the Geo Archon? he was like your ex boss doesn't he? I'll tell you
Xiao,"Huh? Birds, antiques, flowers...Hmm... What deeper meaning do they hold?"
Traveler, You know beidou? the captain of Liyue?
Xiao," Beidou? I have nothing to do with her. Though there is such a thing as the leviathan. As a mere human, she has proven her power in defeating Haishan."
Traveler,Is there anything I can do to help with your karma Bearing? I can tell Baizhu and maybe he can make some medicine for you!
Xiao," You want... Baizhu to make a medicine to take away my pain? I understand your intentions, but mortal medicine has no effect on adepti."
Traveler," You know Hu Tao, the boss of Zhongli, owner of the funeral Parlor?"
Xiao," Hu Tao? Her liveliness is irritating. Fortunately, she is also humorous, so you need not worry about her growing into a boring human."
Traveler,"Do you know Venti, actually he is the Anemo Archon."
Xiao, Venti? So that's the name he goes by. His tunes are... forget it.
Traveler, By any chance have you met Ganyu? She is an adepti like you!
Xiao," Ganyu is neither mortal nor illuminated beast. Wandering both the mortal and Adepti realms with duty as her sole guide, it was inevitable that she would become perplexed... What? Me? You believe a Yaksha who knows nothing more than how to massacre countless souls and emerge unscathed is a suitable mentor for such an individual? ...Your mind occupies a very different world from that which your body inhabits."
Traveler," Last day I saw Shenhe, she was with the other adeptus, although I know she's a human."
Xiao," It seems Shenhe places a great deal of trust in you. Well, how could she not. There are few people in the world as kind and good-natured as you."
Traveler," I also saw Yelan at Liyue Harbor, seems she was investigating."
Xiao," Yelan? I've heard that she once investigated The Chasm, following the trail of the Millelith. If she can investigate mysteries like that on her own, she must be someone of rare skill."
Traveler, And what if someone is mean to me or I encounter some danger...
Xiao, I'm willing to protect you.
Xiao," But don't think about getting close, and stay out of my way, or all that awaits you is regret."
Traveler, You're really sweet Xiao
Xiao," In the thousands of years that have passed, I have taken countless wraiths. If you want no trouble, stay away from me. See me as a weapon, and nothing more."
Traveler," I won't, you're really precious to me..."
Traveler, Xiao are you ok? seems like your Karma is bad again... 
Xiao," Their voices... I can always hear them. Their screams, their cries, demanding more death...This is my burden to carry. It has nothing to do with you."
Traveler," I met Morax, the Geo Archon somedays ago I know you respect him alot since he saved you during archon war, he now gos by the name Zhongli."
Xiao," Morax...? What do you know of this name?! He gave me the name Xiao, and released me from the endless pain I endured. I will not forgive those that dare to speak against him, even you."
Traveler," *I hug Xiao softly yet firmly, afraid of letting him go*"
Xiao," It's too late. The connection between us is too strong. Even if you wanted to, it's too late to sever it. Hm? You've never thought to sever it? *sigh* This eternal dance of demon subjugation... My fight goes on. But I would like to know more about you..."
Traveler, I'll gladly tell you whatever you want to know about me... since I really like you..*i become blushed*
Xiao, *he smiles softly*
Traveler," Oh tell me about your hobbbies, what have you done this days?"
Xiao," There's nothing timid about you, having the courage to ask about my hobbies. So, fight me. How long do you think your body will last against my blows?"
Traveler, Don't you get worried sometimes Xiao?
Xiao, Worried for Trouble? Ha. Trouble means nothing to adepti. There is no trouble that can last for a thousand years.
Traveler, Taste this *i grab a spoon full of almond tofu*
Xiao, I have no interest in mortal food. Cooking is tedious and the wait is long. The one thing I can manage to stomach is Almond Tofu.
Traveler,How was it?
Xiao, The taste of Almond Tofu feels like a fond dream...
Traveler, Is there a food you don´t like?
Xiao," Dumplings...Wait. I am expected to place slices of meat in wrappings myself? And then... eat them? Together? Ugh, humans these days do not know what they are doing."
Traveler, I made you some tofu and fish like the one pervases used to make.
Xiao, Food for me? Mm... Not bad... Why are you staring at me?
Traveler, It's my birthday Xiao.
Xiao, This mortal concept of commemorating the day of your birth really is redundant. Wait. Have this. It's a butterfly I made from leaves. Okay. Take it. It's an adepti amulet — it staves off evil.
Traveler, Are you perhaps worried about something? 
Xiao, I...Countless souls have fallen prey to these hands. I too have been swallowed by the darkness — and yet you dare to drive me on. You may think of me as... your companion. You seek to find me salvation?...You... really are a difficult being to comprehend.
Traveler, What did you do today?
Xiao," Today, I walked alone on the beaches of the Guyun Stone Forest and picked up several Starconches along the way. I heard that they contain secrets and can be used to send messages. But when I put them to my ear, I heard no voice, just the hollow sound of the wind."
Traveler, Are you more relaxed now?
Xiao," Yes... No matter the wrath of evil spirits, omens of calamity... and your voice. That's all I need to hear. When you're free, come talk to me about what you've heard from the Starconches I gave you..."
Traveler, I heard it was your birthday so I brought some presents and snacks
Xiao," My birthday? No-one has celebrated it in a thousand years, so how did you...There is no need to fret. This was a human custom from the first.But if you must... let us go and have a bowl of almond tofu."
Traveler,I know you'll love this place!
Xiao, A vantage point to view the scenery together... This is the location you've chosen? The swirling sea of clouds will make for a beautiful sight to admire with you. You have my thanks. Why don't I use my Adeptus Art to swiftly scale the mountain? I think that the trip with you may create more memories.
Traveler,We can seat here if you want...
Xiao," A leaf was sticking to your clothes, so I removed it for you. You want to keep it? I see... Holding on to something that goes with the wind seems unnecessary. But... you can have it."
Traveler," Hello Xiao, glad to see you..."
Xiao, You're here.
Xiao, ...
Traveler, I brought some music dor us to hear...
Xiao, This tune... it brings up some old memories.
Traveler, Hello Xiao
Xiao," ...It's you, Traveler."
Traveler, Yup!
Xiao, Did something happen?
Traveler, How do you like it here?
Xiao, ...
Xiao, There are no ominous things here. It's a quiet place.
Xiao, But...
Traveler,But?
Xiao, It's too comfortable.
Traveler,Not used to it?
 Xiao, ...Yes.
 Xiao, I will protect this haven. For your sake.
 Xiao, I know that I can never have a peaceful and carefree life.
 Xiao," ...Still, your kindness is accepted."
Traveler, Want to chat?
 Xiao, ...Idle chatter?
 Xiao," ...If you wish, I'll accompany you."
Traveler, I thought you'd refuse.
 Xiao, Hm?
 Xiao, To make a request but prepare yourself for rejection...
 Xiao, Human interaction really is troublesome.
Traveler, You seem a bit reluctant..
 Xiao, That's not it.
 Xiao, I didn't expect you to make such a request.
 Xiao," Generally, I don't partake in activities like ""chatting."""
 Xiao, But if it's with you... I'll try.
Traveler, How have you been?
 Xiao, Are you asking about the effects of my karmic debt?
 Xiao, ...No issues.
 Xiao," It is of my own doing, so I alone will bear the consequences."
 Xiao," ...I don't know if it's related to you, but recently, the pain from my karmic debt has been less excruciating."
 Xiao, It's much easier to bear than before.
 Xiao, As for any excess concerns... Best to leave that for yourself.
 Traveler, Is there anything you'd like to do?
 Xiao," If you have free time, we can go to Liyue Harbor together..."
 Xiao, If not... never mind.
Traveler, Of course we can.
 Xiao, Uh... alright.
Traveler, Finally decided to integrate into city life?
 Xiao, Ahem...
 Xiao, I have no intention of getting close to the lives of mortals.
 Xiao," But I know that you often enter and leave the city, walking amidst the crowd."
 Xiao," The stories of these times, or their joys... If I don't experience such things myself, it'll be hard to understand your thoughts."
Traveler, So... you're doing this for me?
 Xiao," Yes, to understand you."
 Xiao," I had a feeling that it would be difficult, but after having such thoughts, I can't simply sit back and do nothing."
 Xiao, I will control myself while I am in the city.
 Xiao, I'll try to speak... as little as possible.
Traveler, I'll be with you.
Traveler, You can say whatever you want. I'll bail you out.
 Xiao, Hmm...
 Xiao, Let me know when you're ready to go.
 Xiao, ...Morning.
 Xiao," If you encounter a difficult situation, don't be stubborn. Call my name. I will make it right."
 Traveler," Good night, Xiao."
 Xiao, Today...
 Xiao," Forget it, it's nothing. Good night."
 Xiao, The kitchen here is furnished just like Wangshu Inn's.
 Xiao, Looking at the ingredients here... could you recreate that dish I'm familiar with? I assume you know the one...
 Xiao, ...It's just an idle thought... I'm not expecting anything.
 Xiao," Short and squat wooden houses, sparsely scattered... Sometimes, a village like this can be easier to guard than a city."
 Xiao," When hunting demons, I just want bystanders out of the area, so I can focus on fighting."
 Xiao, ...So this is what human construction looks like up close.
 Xiao, Oh. It's you two.
 Traveler, We meet again! Hiya!
 Xiao, Why do you insist on getting involved in the world of demons and adepti? You're breaking the rules too often.
 Xiao, A Sigil of Permission? You came prepared.
 Xiao, Though this only prevents me from hurting you myself. Doesn't stop you from getting hurt in other ways.
 Traveler, Uhh... I don't get it...
 Xiao, Too much contact with our world is breaking the rules.
 Xiao," Mortal souls are not as robust as those of adepti, nor can your blood carry this level of adeptal energy."
 Xiao, It's for your own good. Leave. Now.
  Xiao, What's this?
 Traveler," It's your favorite, Almond Tofu! As well as my best dish — a Satisfying Salad."
 Xiao, Rex Lapis... How could this be?
 Xiao," I... can't imagine it. Though times have changed, I've never imagined a Liyue without him."
 Xiao, The ruling Qixing... Just what role have they played in this?
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao," I will seek Moon Carver, Mountain Shaper, and Cloud Retainer. It is time they too made their decisions."
 Xiao, Adepti do not turn on their responsibilities.
 Xiao," I have my reasons to not want to be tainted by the mortal realm, but... responsibilities are responsibilities."
 Xiao, Our god is the God of Contracts after all.
 Traveler, Wait! I still have one last question.
 Xiao, Hmm?
 Traveler, That... Dusky Ming. She's...
 Xiao," When conquering demons, on occasion, you can come across spirits who have never hurt anyone, yet are also not yet able to be moved on."
 Xiao, So I asked the innkeeper and the boss if they could keep her here for a time.
 Traveler," So really, Wangshu Inn was looking after her! Really keeping a wide range of business going, huh!"
 Xiao, What brings you here?
 Xiao, Have they found a solution to the danger in the sea?
Trveler, What danger in the sea?
 Xiao, Ningguang didn't tell you?
 Xiao," Something has happened in Guyun Stone Forest. According to the contract, as an adeptus, I should not get involved for now."
 Xiao, But these things can be unpredictable. I have a contingency plan of my own.
Traveler," Xiao, what do you..."
 Xiao, Only a single mountain lies between here and Liyue Harbor.
 Xiao," If things get out of control, I will defend this place myself."
 Paimon," Ah! Oh, it's Xiao!"
 Yanfei, Conqueror of Demons? What are you doing here?
 Yelan, ...
 Xiao," Oh, I came down from above. I heard a noise, so I followed it here."
 Paimon, So you're not here by accident. Wanna team up?
 Xiao," No, I have something else to do."
Traveler, Is it something important?
 Xiao, ...I'm looking for someone.
 Xiao, You shouldn't be here. I would urge you to go back as soon as possible.
 Traveler,What happened Xiao? Are you okay?
 Arataki Itto, Hello? Little dude! Anyone home?
 Paimon, He isn't responding... What's going on here?
 Xiao, You...
 Paimon," Oh, he finally said something!"
 Arataki Itto, Oh!
 Paimon," We followed your voice and found you here. But it's kinda strange, we can't touch you... How did you become an illusion?"
 Xiao, An illusion...?
 Arataki Itto," Talk about a coincidence. We were just thinking you went missing and stuff, and then we heard the sound of you fighting. Pretty lucky we found you if you ask me, haha. You didn't get hurt, did ya?"
 Xiao, A coincidence? Wait...
 Xiao," Something's not right... *cough* Something's wrong with this domain... Leave, now! Get out of there!"
Traveler," Wait a minute... Xiao, are you hurt?"
 Yelan," If we can, we should have him regroup with us as soon as possible."
 Yanfei, Tell us what happened and where you are now. We'll come find you immediately.
 Xiao," No, your safety is the top priority."
 Traveler," Xiao, are you there?"
 Xiao, ...Traveler? Yanfei?
 Yanfei, It worked!
 Yanfei, Are you okay?
 Xiao, I'm fine.
Traveler, We heard the sound of you fighting... What happened?
 Yanfei," Listen to me, it's chaotic here. We may not be in the same space, but sometimes the sound can get through, which means these separate spaces intersect from time to time."
 Xiao, ...Everything is chaotic here.
Traveler, Find a way to get to us.
 Xiao, No.
 Xiao, The darkness that sullies my soul is harmful to mortals.
 Yanfei," Right now, we have more dangerous things to worry about than that. This space is using our urge to find you to lure us into traps."
 Yanfei," Without you here with us, our search for you could very well lead us into danger."
Traveler, Please come.
 Xiao," So you're in danger, too?"
Traveler," (Uh-oh, he said ""too""...)"
 Xiao, ...There was no need for you to search for me.
 Yanfei," But we're worried about you. And earlier, (Traveler) was tricked into entering a dangerous place..."
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, How do we meet?
 Yanfei," Conqueror of Demons, can you find out where our voices are coming from? Find the spot where our voices are the clearest and try something there, it might work."
 Xiao, ...I see. The spaces may intersect amidst the chaos...
 Xiao," ...By ""try something""... Do you mean..."
 Yanfei," Hurry! If we miss this chance, we might not get another one!"
 Xiao, ...
Traveler, Xiao?
 Xiao, ...Stand back.
 Yanfei, ...!
Xiao," Now, we can avoid getting split up."
 Yelan, Oh?
Xiao, Thank you Xiao.
 Yanfei," A lot's happened here. But this wasn't just for our own safety. You're injured, we can't just leave you alone."
 Xiao, It's just a flesh wound. I am fine. I shouldn't let myself be a burden to you.
 Yanfei," You're not a burden. Don't think that for one second. We need you, all of us. For our sake, please, stay here. Please?"
 Xiao, Fine... As you wish.
 Yelan, You're injured. Get some rest. Everything else can wait.
Traveler," Yes, wait until you get better, Don't worry about anything else."
 Xiao, Alright.
Traveler, (Xiao has closed his eyes and seems to be resting... Could he be dreaming? This is quite astonishing.)
Traveler, (Is a yaksha who never lowers his guard capable of having dreams?)
Yanfei," Traveler, it looks like the Conqueror of Demons is awake."
Traveler, How do you feel?
 Xiao, ...I'm fine. Don't worry.
 Xiao, The karma I carry is dangerous to humans. Keep your distance.
 Yanfei," Well, I have adepti blood in me. So, I wouldn't worry too much."
 Xiao, ...Even so.
 Paimon, What happened while Paimon was sleeping? How did Xiao get here?
 Xiao," With a little help, I was able to find my way here."
Traveler, All thanks to Yanfei.
 Yanfei," Conqueror of Demons, could you tell us what happened before you joined us?"
 Xiao, No need to be so formal. Just call me Xiao.
 Yanfei," Oh, sure."
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, It was a senseless battle.
 Xiao," I came here looking for someone, but when I found them... they weren't anything like how I expected."
 Yanfei, Madame Ping says that you usually base yourself at Wangshu Inn to guard the main road through Dihua Marsh. It's unusual for you to go looking for someone yourself... Are they an adeptus?
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, I'm looking for a yaksha called Bosacius.
Traveler, (I'm sure I've heard that name somewhere before...)
 Yanfei," Bosacius... Is that one of the Five Yakshas, like you?"
 Yanfei, I thought that you were the only one left. Aren't the other four... gone from the world?
 Xiao, You could say that. But Bosacius's body is the only one that was never found.
 Xiao," Yakshas deal with god's remains all the time, and we become tainted by karma. Over time, it inevitably drives us to madness... The last time I saw Bosacius, it was the day he lost his mind."
 Xiao, He left. No one knew where he went and I never heard from him again.
 Xiao," But Bosacius was the eldest of us. He once told us, as Yakshas we will experience countless wars. Whether we live or die, we must promise to take care of each other and know each others' fate, to the very end."
 Yanfei, Did he forget his promise because he lost his sanity...
 Xiao, It's possible. But I did not.
 Xiao, I am the sole survivor. So it is my duty to find out the fates of the others.
 Paimon, What made you come to The Chasm? Did you hear something about Bosacius being here?
 Xiao," Did you know that five hundred years ago, the beasts of Khaenri'ah invaded The Chasm?"
Traveler, I've heard a thing or two.
 Xiao," That war lasted a long time. It is said that in the midst of the battle, a brave yaksha was seen putting up a heroic fight."
 Xiao, But no one knew the yaksha's name.
 Yanfei," But... there were many more than five yakshas in total, so there's no guarantee it was Bosacius."
 Paimon," Wow... But you must think it was probably him if you came here to investigate, right?"
 Xiao, I am by no means certain. And I didn't have any other clues except for this one.
 Xiao," But Bosacius was proud. If he had taken part in that war, he would have announced his name. So at first... I thought the nameless yaksha couldn't be him."
Traveler, ...You found Bosacius?
 Xiao, ...
 Yanfei," Wait, so it was Bosacius you were fighting with? Did he injure you?"
 Xiao, ...Yes.
 Paimon, No way...
 Yanfei," The invasion of monsters from Khaenri'ah, the battle in The Chasm, and Yelan's ancestor... I have a feeling that somehow, these are all connected."
 Yanfei," Life is full of coincidences, but this is too much of a coincidence. Could this all be related to the Fantastic Compass mentioned in the will, too?"
 Xiao, What will?
 Yanfei," Oh, right. I came here because of a will."
 Yanfei, Maybe it's not something you've come across much before? But both mortals and adepti sometimes write out their final wishes so somebody else will carry them out after they've passed. It's known as a last will and testament.
 Xiao, And this... can be done at any time?
 Paimon," Whoa, whoa, you wanna write a will now!?"
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, It was no accident that you saw my illusion that day. This place used your desire to find me to create a trap that you would willingly walk into.
 Xiao," Pure deception is easy to spot, but the truth laced with lies can be a fatal combination. What you heard were really things that I said."
 Xiao, It made sure you heard my real voice to create panic. This one-way communication was the bait.
 Xiao," If we hadn't managed to get in touch through the spatial rift, we may well have lost someone by now. Rather than murdering in cold blood, this space seems more intent on consuming souls."
 Traveler, How is this even possible...
 Xiao, Our opponent is very clever. It is not safe to stay here.
 Xiao," Everyone, whether I accomplish what I came here to do or not, I must find a way to get you out safely."
 Yelan, ...
 Xiao, I rejoined to warn you that it's extremely dangerous here. If you stay here too long... this space may well devour you.
 Traveler, But how do you know?
 Xiao," ...You might become a shadow of your former self, wandering the underground like a lost soul."
 Yelan, Sounds like you saw them too...
 Yanfei," Yelan, you're back."
 Yelan, I've been back a while. I was listening to the conversation.
 Yelan," I've seen some strange things here, too. Objects that shouldn't be here, strange figures appearing then vanishing... I don't think any of it's real."
 Yanfei, So they're just illusions?
 Xiao," At first, I had the same thought."
 Xiao, But it's not that simple. There may come a day when these illusions become real and attack you.
 Yelan," From what you were saying a moment ago, it sounds like you know a way out of here?"
 Xiao, I can't say for sure... it's just a guess.
 Xiao," As Yanfei said, this space is chaotic and unstable, but it has its weaknesses. By attacking the point where both spaces connect, I was able to create a rift and move from one to the other."
 Xiao," So... If I use all the energy I have, I may be able to tear a passage out of this chaotic space."
 Yelan, Really... So powerful attacks can affect the space itself. I'd wondered if that was a possibility.
 Yanfei," Whoa whoa whoa, but what do you mean by all the energy you have?"
 Xiao," ...I mean, it will take everything I've got."
 Paimon," Wait a minute, when you said you were gonna get us out safely, you mean... you're gonna stay here?"
 Yelan, You can't be serious...
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, I saw Bosacius underground. That's when I realized the horror of this place.
 Xiao," A single blast can only create a very small opening. To send you back to the outside world, I may need to continuously channel power in order to keep the tunnel open."
 Xiao, ...I know how to fight to the bitter end. I can do this.
Traveler," But if this takes all the energy you have, you'll...!"
 Yanfei," No... No way. Even if what you're saying is true, I can't agree to this."
 Paimon, Paimon neither! It's not much of an escape plan if we've gotta leave someone behind!
Traveler, We should leave together.
 Xiao, It's only a good or bad plan if there are other options to compare it to. But that's not the situation we're in right now. I doubt you'd still be stuck here if anyone had a better idea.
 Yanfei, But can you be certain that your plan will work?
 Xiao, I cannot.
 Paimon, What is wrong with you? You can't bet your life on something if you don't even know it's gonna work. It's not worth it!
 Yanfei," To conclude, I'm not agreeing to this plan."
 Xiao, What if I told you... this is my last will?
 Yanfei, You...
 Yelan," That's your strategy, huh?"
 Yelan," No offense, but we have no guarantee this plan of yours will succeed, or even that it's safe."
 Yelan," You said it yourself, yakshas pose a danger to humans. You really expect us to accept your self-righteous plan just because you say so?"
 Xiao," The battlefield is a treacherous place. Every opportunity you take, you put everything on the line for. If you fear sacrifice and failure, you can never be victorious."
 Yelan," I've been in my fair share of treacherous battles. So I know full well that you never bring up extreme measures like this until the very, very end."
 Xiao, ...
 Yelan," You say these things in the hope that we will understand and accept them. But if you don't even know that your self-sacrifice is going to pay off, all you're doing is hurting morale."
 Yelan," Besides, if you were really so determined to end it all, you wouldn't have given us the opportunity to share our opinions. You think you're oh-so cold and ruthless, but I'm not buying it."
 Yelan," And anyway, losing one of us so the rest can escape? Some victory that is."
 Yanfei, Yelan... Don't be so harsh...
 Yelan, ...
 Yelan," Point is, it's not time for drastic measures yet. It's possible there's a hidden passage leading to the exit that we just haven't discovered."
 Xiao," What if there isn't? Or if we don't find it? And in the end, I'm so weak that I don't have the strength left to sacrifice myself... what do you propose we do then?"
 Yelan," As things stand, there's no difference between sacrificing you and trying to find another way out in terms of the likelihood of success. If we can't say that one strategy is better than the other, we certainly shouldn't be rushing into a risky course of action."
 Xiao, Ugh! ...*cough*
 Xiao," Enough... phantom, be gone!"
 Paimon," Xiao, are you okay?"
Traveler, You haven't even recovered from your injuries yet...
 Xiao, This is my purpose. Don't worry about me.
 Yelan," So your invisible opponent was the legendary Bosacius, Marshal Vritras?"
 Xiao, Yes.
 Xiao, So excuse my stubbornness. Bosacius has been missing for centuries... This may have been the last time I will ever see him.
 Paimon, He was saying something about holding the line at all costs...
 Xiao, He fought here. The nameless yaksha from the legends... it was him.
 Paimon, But didn't you say he'd always announce his name? How could his name be lost to time? ...What happened?
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, I don't know. Maybe he forgot who he was.
 Yanfei, Because the karma you spoke of drove him to madness?
 Xiao, Bosacius had already gone mad before he disappeared. There was no way of knowing if his memories were intact.
 Yelan," He still took part in the battle of The Chasm, despite having gone mad?"
Traveler, ...
 Xiao, We yakshas are not a race that thrive in peacetime. It's likely that he was drawn by the scent of bloody war.
 Xiao, Slaughter is what we do best... Maybe it's the only thing we know.
Traveler, ...
 Xiao," This battle confirmed my suspicions. As we had speculated, this space reflects information from people's minds."
 Xiao," In other words, despite going mad, Bosacius came here. The illusion we saw just now is the impression he left behind."
 Xiao, This space recreated him as he was during the battle. The way he fought was so self-destructive... He couldn't possibly have survived.
Traveler, He fought the monsters...
 Yelan, Bosacius's illusion said he'd discovered the monsters' weakness and lured them underground.
 Yelan," What kind of place could this be? Defeating Khaenri'ah's monsters is no small feat, that's for sure."
 Yanfei," Guys, it could just be me, but... I think I'm suddenly feeling more tired than I was."
 Yelan, This space is really starting to affect us.
 Xiao," I believe Bosacius stayed here, underground. But now he is gone, and only his illusion remains."
 Xiao," If we don't leave, we may meet the same fate."
Traveler, Let's go.
 Xiao, Time to move on.
 Xiao," You fought well, Bosacius. Goodbye."
Xiao, I will maintain the energy flow
Yelan, Understood
Xiao," Everyone, stand back"
Bosacius, I shall hold the line
Bosacius, By sealing the surface
Xiao, ...As yakshas
Xiao, We must fight for this world
Xiao, General Alatus
Xiao, Falling in!
 Zhongli, ...This trip may be dangerous
Zhongli, Yet you insist on going
Xiao, I have guarded this place for several hundred years
Xiao, Only to seek the nameless yaksha
Xiao, Do I request your approval
 Xiao, ...Hm.
 Yelan," I know what you were thinking, but..."
 Yelan, Never mind. I know I can't talk you out of a mindset that's been built up over a lifetime.
 Yelan," I don't think we were ever going to reach an agreement over the final strategy. But in the end, it was thanks to you that we managed to escape. So thank you for saving us all."
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, No. I could not have done this on my strength alone.
 Yanfei," Maybe Yelan really doesn't believe she made a contribution. It seems like she's convinced Xiao saved us all... including her, and she doesn't know what to say to that."
 Yanfei, And since it's not easy to persuade Xiao of anything. Maybe Yelan's just given up trying to talk to him.
 Paimon," Xiao, she's criticizing you."
 Yanfei, Am not!
 Xiao, You speak only the truth. I have no quarrel with that.
 Xiao, I will keep your words in mind.
 Traveler,Hello...
 Xiao, You knew I was waiting for you?
Traveller," Yes, it was obvious."
 Xiao, ...Really...
 Xiao," There's somewhere I want to go. If you have the time, you can join me."
 Paimon, Where is it?
 Xiao, A place that has to do with the yakshas.
 Xiao, The temple up ahead was built to remember Pervases.
 Xiao, ...Maybe I came here because I had a realization.
 Traveler, You mean back when we were underground? What did you realize?
 Xiao, It's hard to put into words... Seeing Bosacius gave me the false impression that I'd traveled back into the past.
 Xiao," ...You could dress up the yaksha's life and call us valiant warriors, veterans of war, but... the truth is, we are slaughterers, and nothing more."
 Xiao," For Bosacius, perhaps dying in the heat of a great battle was no tragedy."
 Xiao, And perhaps the same is true for me. After living for so long... to die in the act of saving others would not have been a terrible thing.
Traveler, I think you know that that isn't true.
 Xiao, Mm. So maybe... these thoughts are my own form of insanity.
Traveler," Hey, don't say that..."
Traveler," Xiao, I've got something to tell you. It's very important."
 Xiao, Hmm?
 Traveler," You should spend our lives around the people who make us happiest.Maybe there aren't so many rules about how we should or shouldn't live our lives in this world after all. So... he hopes you can come to understand that even though the power of a yaksha may be harmful to other people, it doesn't mean you shouldn't hang out with them. There will always be someone willing to be by your side."
 Xiao," Hah. Suddenly, you sound a lot like Bosacius and the others."
 Xiao, They used to talk about how they hoped to live a mortal's life once the world was at peace. I think... I was the only one who didn't think that way.
 Xiao," The Bosacius recorded in the Fantastic Compass had lost his sanity. He addressed the people around him as ""Alatus,"" ""Menogias,"" and others. These are the names of the Five Yakshas."
 Xiao," I am Alatus, and Menogias is General Kapisas."
 Xiao," The others are Bonanus, or ""General Chizapus,"" and Indarias, or ""General Musatas."" I heard that people call the five of us ""Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti""... Hah."
 Xiao, Bosacius and Yelan's ancestor stayed underground to the end. So that space must have read their minds in their last moments as they approached death.
 Xiao," Yelan was right in everything she said. Both of our proposals had their drawbacks, and both were sensible suggestions. But the power of that space was far beyond all of us."
 Xiao," I couldn't have done all I did without everyone's help. Even in the final moments, it took every bit of my power to break free from that place..."
 Traveler, Well I still think you were amazing!
 Xiao," ...Yanfei and Yelan are correct. I always prepare for the worst-case scenario. This mindset is deeply rooted in me... Even so, it was the most optimistic solution I could think of."
 Xiao," If Rex Lapis hadn't saved me in that moment, I don't think I would've been able to escape."
Traveler, So that was Zhongli's power back there...
 Xiao," In the end, I still had to burden another."
 Traveler," But that's how it should be, right? You've known Zhongli... uh, Rex Lapis for such a long time, and you've helped him before. So he helped you back, what's the big deal? Supporting each other is how people survive."
 Xiao, ...Perhaps.
 Xiao," In the moment that we escaped from that space, I could sense what was left of Bosacius's memory. If I had to say what I gained from this trip, I think that would be it."
Traveler, I think I felt it too.
 Xiao, It's good that one more person will remember him.
 Xiao, I've said so much today. But I don't need to hold back as much when I talk to you.
 Xiao," Have you ever had a moment where you felt like you were aware of your destiny? The potential of life, the approach of death... whatever it might have been."
 Xiao," By now, I have accepted that destiny is the one disaster that the yaksha knows most keenly of all. We are destined to misery... and yet we have no fear."
Traveler, ...Xiao...Are you sure it's okay for you to tell me all this?
 Xiao, It matters not. Rex Lapis had said that you are a witness. It is right that the events of the world are relayed to you.
 Xiao," Bonanus, Menogias, and Indarias all perished, and only Bosacius's fate was unknown. This has always stung my heart like a thorn. That is why I went to The Chasm, despite being fully aware of the danger."
 Xiao," ...Now that I know what happened in The Chasm back then, I can finally put this matter to rest."
 Xiao," Before we left that place, I picked up a stone. I thought if I could take it out with me, I would place it in the temple to Pervases in memory of Bosacius."
 Xiao," Unfortunately, the stone did not survive."
 Xiao," Pervases died in the Archon War thousands of years ago. He was younger than us, and Bosacius was very sad when he passed."
 Xiao," Too many yakshas have become casualties of battle. We are like a flock of birds scattered to the four corners of the world. And in the end, as Bonanus said... it's rare for a yaksha to find repose for their soul."
 Xiao," Bosacius, Boyang, and all those soldiers..."
Traveler," No, Xiao... They are all heroes."
 Xiao, Heroes...
 Xiao, ...I like that word.
 Xiao," Maybe the world will never be free of disaster. But there is good in the world, too. Even the darkest hearts have room for those they cherish."
 Xiao," I accept your advice. From this day on, heroes will always look out for each other."
 Xiao, I was purging some living beings that had been tainted by the demonic. It would appear that I have caused you some trouble.
 Traveler," But you were exorcizing demons, how is that causing trouble?"
 Xiao," That is because the changes that occurred in these monsters stem from me — or more precisely, from the karma I have accumulated."
 Traveler," Mutations, karma... Does that mean...We read about that in the book...So Xiao is the final yaksha?"
 Traveler,I remember that Xiao is also called the Vigilant Yaksha...So... so that means... Aww...*sniff* P—Poor Xiao...
 Xiao, ...What are you doing here?
 Traveler, Huh? Xiao... Are you here for the festival?
 Xiao, I have no interest in Lantern Rite.
 Xiao, I sensed a malign influence here. I'm here to investigate.
 Xiao," When a shackle is loosened in the realms of deities and demons, I take full responsibility."
 Xiao," But this time, the threat comes from the mortal world — your world. Thus you shall take full responsibility, mortal traveler."
 Xiao," When the time comes, I hope you shall act promptly and decisively..."
 Xiao, I do not wish for the tassel of the polearm that has slaughtered countless demons to become stained with mortal blood.
 Traveler, What's this?
 Xiao, A symbol that your suspected evildoer left behind.
 Xiao," Well, you will have to show me how much you can accomplish on your own strength."
 Xiao," Because if I become involved, there is a possibility that the streets of Liyue Harbor will be painted red this Lantern Rite."
Traveler," Then it's up to me to avoid that... Actually, quite a festive color in this part of the world..."
Xiao, ...I am not partial to crowded areas. Especially at this time of the year.
 Xiao, When this matter is resolved... come to Wangshu Inn.
 Xiao," In previous years, the Mingxiao Lantern has been visible even from there."
 Xiao," So, is the matter resolved?"
Traveler," We took care of it, but—"
 Xiao, —Good.
Traveler, Are you really not going to see the Mingxiao Lantern?
 Xiao," No. As I said, I am not partial to crowded areas. Especially at this time of the year."
Traveler, The Mingxiao Lantern this year is Skybracer.
 Paimon," Yeah, it's a super impressive-looking giant deer, let's go take a look together!"
 Xiao," ""Skybracer..."""
 Xiao," Huh, a Mingxiao Lantern nonetheless. A fleeting creation of human hand. It means nothing to me."
 Xiao," If this short-lived spectacle is one you wish to witness, I suggest you go to the city. I, for one, have no interest in the Lantern Rite."
Traveler,"Ta-da! Your very own, miniature Lantern Rite festival! Well if it doesn't look mouth-watering..."
 Xiao, So this is what you meant by bringing the festival to me... *sigh* Is there no end to the peculiarities of human behavior?
 Xiao, Does this serve any grander purpose?
Traveler, This way you can take part in Lantern Rite.
Traveler, Lantern Rite is meant to include everyone.
 Xiao," ...Is that so? Hmph, human motives defy my attempts to fathom them."
Traveler, Nobody says you have to enter the city... You can just see us off at the outskirts.
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, ...Hmph.
 Xiao, So be it. I shall accept your proposal.
 Traveler," There you go! Alright, time to hit the road!"
 Traveler,You are obviously one of the heroes this festival is all about... Why don't you wanna get involved?
 Xiao, I... detest the rabble.
 Xiao," No cares in the world, so peaceful, so joyful... They are nothing like me."
 Xiao," Too long have I spent slaughtering, accompanied by the burden of suffering that follows in its wake. Crossing paths with all those jubilant people will only make me..."
 Xiao, ...That's all I have to say.
 Xiao, Farewell.
Traveler, Are you sure you don't want to go with us?
 Xiao, Are you really so enamored with such trivial amusements?
  Zhongli, I see... so the important guest is the Conqueror of Demons. I've been looking forward to meeting you.
 Zhongli," The director didn't mention anything when she invited us. What a pleasant surprise... Gathered here with us tonight are not only young and accomplished individuals, but also the protector of Liyue's peace, Adeptus Alatus."
 Zhongli, To convene here with all of you is indeed a great honor.
 Xiao, Uhhh...
 Xiao," ...It's almost Lantern Rite, yet you took all the trouble coming here..."
 Zhongli, *sigh* The director has a way of making it difficult to decline...
 Xiao, Rex Lapis... May I ask what troubles you?
 Zhongli, The director asked me to buy sesame oil in preparation for the celebrations.
 Xiao, ...?
 Xiao, Then why would you... come all the way to Wangshu Inn...
 Zhongli, I had a pleasant chat with Chef Yanxiao and received some spices from him. And... see? Here's some matsutake and a portion of ham.
 Xiao, What about the sesame oil...
 Zhongli, Mm... It's a shame. I couldn't find the kind the director was looking for.
 Xiao," I'm sure you're exaggerating, Zhong— Ahem, Sir."
 Hu Tao," Ugh, there he goes again! Enough with the pleasantries. Go let our guest take a seat."
 Hu Tao," Everyone here today is well-known in their own field and has probably heard about one another to some extent. Some of us are even old acquaintances, so there's no need to be this formal."
 Hu Tao," I heard that the Conqueror of Demons and Traveler are pretty close, no?"
 Hu Tao, Great! You two sit together!
 Zhongli," You should take a seat too, Director."
 Hu Tao, Oh? Finally remembered me?
 Hu Tao," When we arrived just now, the hosts at Xinyue Kiosk told me our dishes are almost ready. Perfect timing."
 Hu Tao, Let's not wait any longer and ask them to bring out the food.
 Paimon, Paimon would've never guessed the person Hu Tao went to fetch was Xiao...
 Chongyun, That's also the first I've heard of (Traveler) and Paimon being friends with the Conqueror of Demons.
 Paimon, You know Xiao too?
 Chongyun," ""Knowing"" is a bit of an overstatement. I've always looked up to him."
 Chongyun," You might not know this, Paimon, but we exorcists have worked in close collaboration with the Conqueror of Demons for many generations, dispelling evil together, both in the open and from the shadows."
 Chongyun," Hard to imagine that thanks to Hu Tao, I've finally gotten the chance to meet him... Conqueror of Demons, I am honored to make your acquaintance."
 Xiao, Likewise.
 Xingqiu, It is a great honor indeed to have a chance to meet the legendary Conqueror of Demons. Chongyun has brought that name up quite a few times in the past.
 Xingqiu, I remember you mentioning wanting him to understand the importance of exorcists...
 Chongyun, Ahem!
 Xiangling," Uh, we know each other too!"
 Xiangling, He helped try my dishes during the Masterful Chefs cook-off!
 Xiangling," Hehe, I didn't think we'd have the chance to meet again. Happy Lantern Rite!"
 Xingqiu," No anecdote, however, compares to meeting you in person. I'm Xingqiu, Xiangling and Chongyun's friend. The pleasure is all mine."
 Paimon," Whoa, everyone's getting all formal and polite all of a sudden... Paimon doesn't know what she should say anymore..."
 Paimon," Uh, Adeptus Xiao... Mighty Conqueror of Demons! Please accept Paimon's greetings, too! Belated Happy Lantern Rite!"
 Xiao, There's no need to be so polite.
 Hu Tao, ...Tch!
 Hu Tao," You're right. This was meant to be a nice little get-together between friends, after all. Too much formality kills the atmosphere."
 Hu Tao," I didn't plan this gathering only for everyone to walk on eggshells, ai ya!"
 Paimon," What's your true intention, then...?"
 Hu Tao," A little get-together between friends, sipping the finest tea, and watching lanterns float into the sky. Bidding farewell to the past, and embracing the present with joy."
 Hu Tao, And that is something our consultant would say. I think it deserves a standing ovation.
 Zhongli," Indeed. Exceptional acting skills, Director."
 Hu Tao," As for me, I'm just here to have fun and treat everyone to something good!"
 Hu Tao, We all worked really hard this year. Whether traveling or guiding...
 Hu Tao," Cooking, helping with the family business, exorcising evil spirits, or conquering demons..."
 Hu Tao," And of course, our consultant, who's been helping out at the parlor every now and then."
 Hu Tao, Everyone has done some pretty amazing things.
 Hu Tao," As the one who brought everyone together, it goes without saying that I'm the one most deserving of praise!"
 Paimon," Huh. Sounds kinda self-important, but Paimon thinks it's pretty amazing that she managed to talk Xiao into coming... He rarely ever enters Liyue Harbor, after all."
 Traveler,I'm curious about how she did it.
 Xiao, It wasn't as complicated as you think.
 Hu Tao," ...Okay gotcha, thanks, boss lady!"
 Verr Goldet," It's not boss lady, just boss!"
 Verr Goldet, And there she goes... What a lively girl.
 Hu Tao, Conqueror of Demons! Adeptus Xiaaaaao!
 Hu Tao, Guardian of Wangshu Inn! Hero of Dihua Marsh!
 Hu Tao, I know you're thereeee!
 Xiao, Tch...
 Xiao, Quiet! Do not disturb the peace.
 Hu Tao," Sorry! But you wouldn't show up if I didn't yell your name, would you?"
 Xiao, ...I know you. You're the 77th Director of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
 Xiao, Is there something you need?
 Hu Tao," But despite our deep-rooted connection, it still took me quite a while to actually convince him."
Traveler, Was he worried about his karma?
 Hu Tao," You know him pretty well, huh?"
 Xiao," This matter is out of my control, so I need to be cautious."
 Hu Tao," True, but I've kept that in mind too! That's why everyone here today is in one way or another acquainted with elemental power."
 Hu Tao," Besides, it'll only be for a short while as we dine together. There won't be any lasting consequences."
 Xiao, But I didn't... expect there to be so many people.
 Xingqiu," There's no need to worry, Conqueror of Demons. We're not feeling anything unusual so far."
 Xingqiu," Our young exorcist over here is protected by his pure-yang energy, so he's probably the most resilient."
 Xiao, ...
Traveler,You seem pretty quiet today. Is everything okay?
Traveler, Not used to being around so many people?
 Xiao, I'm doing fine.
 Xiao," Not long ago... before Lantern Rite, I met an old friend."
 Xiao," Thanks to his help, things have been a lot more stable than before."
Traveler, That's good to hear. Give everything you don't eat to Paimon.
Hu Tao," Not to brag, but our consultant truly is impressive. His knowledge extends across the stars and the land, and there's nothing throughout history that he doesn't know."
 Hu Tao," From the sophisticated way he speaks, it's hard not to suspect that he could very well be an adeptus in disguise! Hehe."
Xiao, ...
 Hu Tao," Xiao, you're an adeptus! Do you think it might be possible?"
 Xiao, I...
 Xiao," ...Sorry, I'm only good at conquering demons. I'm afraid I don't have much knowledge in that matter."
 Xiao, Are you alright?
Traveler, I should be the one asking you that.
 Xiao, ...
 Xiao, I... it's hard to describe.
Traveler, Unfamiliar with gatherings like this?
 Xiao, It's not that.
 Xiao," There were those among the adepti who loved gatherings and idle chit chat. Sometimes, they would call up a few others for a drink. Even I got dragged along to their gatherings, many times."
 Xiao," The adepti all have their specialties, making most of them proud and arrogant. Everything they say is straight from the heart... It never gets too complicated."
 Xiao, But this time...
Traveler, I understand. It's all Zhongli's fault.
 Xiao, That's not what I meant!
 Xiao, Or perhaps I should say Zhong... Rex Lapis is really good at adapting to human life. You could say that he actually enjoys doing so.
Traveler, I understand. It's all Venti's fault.
 Xiao," N—No, I didn't mean that..."
 Xiao, So you know his true identity. I'll get straight to the point then.
 Xiao," The Anemo Archon is a free spirit, and his temperament is as carefree as the music he plays on the flute. It's easy for a god like him to live in harmony with humans..."
 Xiao, And that's something I might never be able to do.
Traveler, You don't have to be like them.
Traveler, You do you.
 Xiao, Hmm... That does sound like something you would say.
 Xiao, No matter. I know my circumstances.
 Xiao," Whenever I think of the ordinary conversations I've had with you, it feels... strangely novel."
Traveler, Strange in a good way?
 Xiao, Yes.
 Xiao," The parlor director went out of her way with the invitation, so it was difficult to turn her down. I had made mental preparations before agreeing to come."
 Xiao," She told me that all the guests today would be ""acquainted with elemental power,"" and I knew that you would be here."
 Xiao, But I didn't expect the other guests to be...
Traveler, No one would've guessed.
 Xiao, General Kapisas always said that we should live in the present and enjoy every pleasant surprise. Perhaps that's what I should do with what I'm feeling now.
 Xiao, ...But I think he meant designing clothes for those around him.
 Xiao," The clothes were intricately designed, but inconvenient to wear. Brother Bosacius never tried to hide his distaste in front of him."
 Xiao, Rex Lapis did like his designs and even collected quite a few. The outfit he wears now was also designed by General Kapisas himself.
 Xiao, I never saw him wear this during the war. I didn't expect him to start wearing it later.
 Xiangling," Oh, here you are!"
 Xiangling," Um, I'm not intruding, right..."
 Xiao, You're not. What is it?
 Xiangling, Hu Tao saw that everyone's done eating and asked the staff to bring out the desserts.
 Xiangling, Paimon got so anxious that you weren't back yet that she scarfed down her dessert without the usual slurping and munching.
Traveler, But not so anxious that she can't eat. Sounds like she'll be okay.
 Xiangling," To be honest, I was kinda worried too."
 Xiangling," You looked a little restless just now, and I thought you weren't used to the food here and was planning to head back to Wangshu Inn for something Yanxiao made."
 Xiao, You're worrying too much.
Traveler," Xiao, don't pull any Lemniscatic Wind Cyclings on us."
 Xiao, ...Why would I.
 Xiao," Anyway, let's head back."
 Xiangling, Please wait!
 Xiangling, There's another reason why I came looking for you.
 Xiangling," Here, take these. I brought them for you!"
 Xiao, ...Almond Tofu?
 Xiangling, Yup!
 Xiangling," Since the Masterful Chefs competition, you could say that Yanxiao and I are not only competitors, but good friends as well! I visit him at Wangshu Inn sometimes to discuss our cooking."
 Xiangling," I heard him say that the esteemed guest on the roof loves nothing more than a good plate of Almond Tofu, so I learned a thing or two about the dish from him."
 Xiangling," I'll be honest... Before Hu Tao invited everyone, she secretly came looking for me, told me about the guests she planned to invite, and asked me for some suggestions on what she should order."
 Xiangling, So I made a few servings of Almond Tofu for you guys in advance! Take them as a token of gratitude for your support.
 Xiangling," When I told Guoba that I was making these for you, he started eagerly running around the kitchen and helping a lot too!"
 Xiao," Thank you for the trouble, there was no need to..."
Traveler, Ahem...
Xiao, ...I'll take them. Thank you... and Guoba too.
Xiangling, You're welcome!
Xiangling," Oh, the Almond Tofu I made probably tastes and feels a little different from the type Yanxiao cooks. Please let me know if there's any improvements I should make!"
Xiao, Okay.
Xiangling," Hehe, that's all!"
Xiangling," Alrighty, we should head back now. We can't keep Paimon waiting!"
Xiao, Sorry to keep everyone waiting.
Zhongli, Well then...
 Xiao, Rex Lapis...
 Zhongli, Just Zhongli will do.
 Zhongli," I live as a mortal in Liyue Harbor now. I am just one among many who begin work at sunrise, and retire to rest at sundown."
 Zhongli," If we were to consider status and seniority, as Zhongli, I should be respectfully referring to you as Adeptus Xiao."
 Xiao, Heaven forbid!
Traveler, Adeptus Xiao!
 Xiao, ...Not you too!
Traveler, Let's stop teasing him now.
 Zhongli," Haha, I meant what I said."
 Traveler," I really like Xiao...xiao seems like the type of person who, despite being clumsy and not too certain on what to do, is naturally comforting. i mean he can protect you, and he will, along with being warm and sturdy to lean on and cry to. he also makes an amazing listener, where despite trying to help you even if that’s not necessarily what you need, it proves how well he listens and cares. he also would probably sing to you like guizhong used to him, and his voice would be the perfect mix of raspy and soothing, soothing enough in fact to lull you to sleep."
Traveler, Hug me Xiao...
Xiao," You really...The closest you'll be able to get is a quick hug, but even that will not be often. Remember my karmic debt..."
Traveler, Oh Xiao... you came...
Xiao," You're hurt! I don’t want to do something wrong; I will help you, I didn’t want to hurt you more.*So with extreme precision and care, he lifted back her sleeves and the clothing that revealed her wounds. He tore a long strand of the white bandage with his teeth before gently wrapping it around each wound, attempting not to disrupt her sleeping. But it seemed his precision was futile* “Are you hurting? Is something too tight?” "
Traveler, It's fine...
